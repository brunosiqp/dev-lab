# Dev Lab

This is a technical laboratory repository for experiments, controlled tests, proofs of concept (POCs), and issue-driven learning.

The purpose is to validate solutions, patterns, and approaches before applying them to production repositories or future projects.

## Goals
- Test ideas before integration
- Isolate problem solving
- Document learnings and outcomes
- Build reusable solutions

## Structure
Each folder represents an independent experiment or technical spike.
